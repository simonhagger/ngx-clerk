# ngx-clerk

Welcome to **ngx-clerk**, an unofficial Angular package that integrates with [Clerk](https://clerk.com/).

### ⚠️ Disclaimer: This unofficial package is not affiliated with Clerk.com. It is an unofficial project that aims to provide a seamless integration of Clerk features into Angular applications.

## Prerequisites

- Angular version **17 or higher**.
- Currently, this package supports **client-side operations only**. Server-Side Rendering (SSR) is not supported at the moment.

## Installation

To install `ngx-clerk`, run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm i ngx-clerk
```

## Getting Started

To begin using `ngx-clerk` in your project, follow these steps:

1. Create an app in [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/) and get the Publishable Key.
2. **Inject the ClerkService**: In your `app.component.ts`, inject the `ClerkService` and call its `__init` method. You need to provide at least the Publishable Key and, optionally, any `ClerkOptions`.

```typescript
// Example: app.component.ts
import { Component } from "@angular/core";
import { RouterOutlet } from "@angular/router";
import { ClerkService } from "ngx-clerk";

@Component({
  selector: "app-root",
  standalone: true,
  imports: [RouterOutlet],
  templateUrl: "./app.component.html",
  styleUrl: "./app.component.css",
})
export class AppComponent {
  constructor(private _clerk: ClerkService) {
    this._clerk.__init({
      publishableKey: "pk_test_XXXXXXXX",
    });
  }
}
```

3. **Utilize Observables**: Use the observables provided by the `ClerkService` to access and manage the state throughout your application.
4. **Route Guarding**: Leverage two types of guard to protect routes, ensuring that certain parts of your application are accessible only after authentication or when you are not authenticated.

```typescript
// Example: app-routes.ts
import { Routes } from "@angular/router";
import { catchAllRoute, ClerkAuthGuardService, ClerkNoAuthGuardService } from "ngx-clerk";
import { UserProfilePageComponent } from "./pages/user-profile-page.component";
import { HomePageComponent } from "./pages/home-page.component";
import { LoginPageComponent } from "./pages/login-page.component";

export const routes: Routes = [
  {
    matcher: catchAllRoute("user"),
    component: UserProfilePageComponent,
    canActivate: [ClerkAuthGuardService],
  },
  {
    path: "login",
    component: LoginPageComponent,
    canActivate: [ClerkNoAuthGuardService],
  },
  {
    path: "",
    component: HomePageComponent,
  },
];
```

## Features

- **Clerk UI Components**: All Clerk UI components are readily available and prefixed with `clerk-`. Available components:

  1. `<clerk-sign-in />`
  2. `<clerk-sign-up />`
  3. `<clerk-user-profile />`
  4. `<clerk-user-button />`
  5. `<clerk-organization-profile />`
  6. `<clerk-organization-switcher />`
  7. `<clerk-organization-list />`
  8. `<clerk-create-organization />`

- **ClerkService**: This service is a central part of the package, offering observables for various Clerk resources:
  - `user$` - Emits every time the `UserResource` is updated
  - `session$` - Emits every time the `SessionResource` is updated
  - `organization$` - Emits every time the `OrganizationResource` is updated
  - `client$` - Emits every time the `ClientResource` is updated
  - `clerk$` - Emits when Clerk has loaded
- **ClerkAuthGuardService**: This service implements `canActivate` and `canActivateChild` that can be used to protect routes in your application.
- **ClerkNoAuthGuardService**: This service implements `canActivate` and `canActivateChild` that can be used to avoid routes in your application that should not be accessed when logged in.

## Remaining Tasks

While `ngx-clerk` aims to provide a comprehensive solution for integrating Clerk into Angular applications, there are several areas that are still under development:

- Enhanced API for Custom Pages.
- Implement support for Organization multidomain and proxy features.
- Add support for Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG).

We welcome contributions and suggestions from the community to help us address these tasks and improve `ngx-clerk`.
